### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I first started this project in August 2020 and I am finally submitting it 12 months later. My code has improve heaps. I am more confident with pseudo-class positions, as well as always opting for a mobile-first approach. Planning was of utmost importance in this project.

### Continued development

I still have one issue to solve with the last div in this challenge. Once I figure it out I will re-submit the solution.
