## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid-template-areas
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I first started this project in August 2020 and I am finally submitting it 12 months later. My code has improve heaps. I am more confident with pseudo-class positions, as well as always opting for a mobile-first approach. Planning was of utmost importance in this project.

### Continued development

When I first submitted my solution I still hadn't positioned the divs properly in the desktop design. With help from the FEM community it was suggested that I use grid-areas and after some reading I tried it out and it solved my problem. 

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's Why CSS grid-area is the best property for laying out content](https://youtu.be/duH4DLq5yoo) - It is indeed the best property!

## Acknowledgments

A member of the FEM slack community helped me figure out how to give separate colour borders to the divs. Thanks go to Emma-duru!
Upon my first submission, Chamu from the Slack community helped me try out grid-areas to fix my grid. Worked like a charm! Thank you!
